It allows a single physical machine to run multiple operating systems simultaneously by creating isolated environments (VMs) on one host system.\n\n\nOne computer can handle multiple jobs by running multiple operating systems.\n\n\nFor example, using virtualization tools, we can run Windows, Linux, and macOS VMs on a single machine.\n\n\nThis enables developers or testers to run various environments in parallel.\n\n\n\nLife Before Virtualization\n\n\nApplications (e.g., Tomcat, Apache, MySQL) required dedicated physical servers.\n\n\nManaging physical servers was expensive, required space, cooling, and high maintenance.\n\n\nIt was inefficient, especially when servers were underutilized.\n\n\n\nBenefits / Advantages of Virtual Machines\n\n\nAllows one computer to run multiple operating systems.\n\n\nConverts physical resources (CPU, RAM, storage) into virtual resources.\n\n\nEach virtual machine runs in a completely isolated environment.\n\n\nEach VM requires its own operating system, offering flexibility.\n\n\nServer virtualization is the most common form, widely used in cloud and enterprise environments.\n\n\n\nKey Terminologies\n\n\nHost OS: The actual physical computer and its operating system (e.g., your laptop running Windows 10).\n\n\nGuest OS: The operating system installed inside a virtual machine (e.g., Ubuntu running in VirtualBox).\n\n\nVM (Virtual Machine): The software-based computer running under virtualization.\n\n\nSnapshot: A backup of a VM’s current state; useful for rollback or recovery.\n\n\nHypervisor: The software or firmware that enables virtualization by creating and managing VMs.\n\n\n\nTypes of Hypervisors\n1. Type 1 – Bare Metal Hypervisors\n\n\nRun directly on physical hardware without a host OS.\n\n\nUsed in production environments (high performance, better resource management).\n\n\nExamples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen\n\n\n2. Type 2 – Hosted Hypervisors\n\n\nRun on top of an existing operating system (like any other application).\n\n\nUsed for learning, testing, or development environments.\n\n\nExamples: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, VMware Server\n\n\n\n✅ What is a Cluster?\nA cluster is a group of connected computers (or servers) that work together as a single system to improve performance, availability, and scalability.\nInstead of one powerful machine doing all the work, a cluster spreads the workload across multiple machines (called nodes).\n\n💡 Simple Example:\nThink of a cluster like a team — if one member (node) is unavailable or busy, others can take over. Together, they work faster and more reliably than a single person.\n\n🔑 Key Features of a Cluster:\n\n\nHigh Availability: If one node fails, others keep the system running.\n\n\nLoad Balancing: Work is distributed evenly across all nodes.\n\n\nScalability: You can add more nodes to handle more traffic or jobs.\n\n\nRedundancy: Data or services are often duplicated to prevent failure.\n\n\n\n🖥️ Types of Clusters:\n\n\nLoad Balancing Cluster – Distributes incoming traffic across nodes\n\n\nHigh Availability (HA) Cluster – Ensures services stay up even if one node fails\n\n\nCompute Cluster – Used for high-performance computing (e.g., simulations, data processing)\n\n\nStorage Cluster – Combines storage from multiple nodes (e.g., Hadoop HDFS, Ceph)\n\n\n\n🚀 Real-World Examples:\n\n\nKubernetes cluster (for container orchestration)\n\n\nHadoop cluster (for big data processing)\n\n\nAWS EC2 Auto Scaling Group (works like a cluster)\n\n\nLet me know if you’d like a diagram or a short interview-friendly definition too.\nSure! Here’s a simple explanation with real-world examples to help you clearly understand the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 Hypervisors:\n\n✅ Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal)\n🔹 What it is:\nA Type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the physical hardware. There is no operating system between the hypervisor and the hardware.\n🔹 Example:\nImagine you have a server machine in a data center. Instead of installing Windows or Linux first, you install VMware ESXi directly onto the server. Then you create virtual machines (VMs) inside ESXi. Each VM can run its own OS, like Ubuntu, CentOS, or Windows Server.\n🔹 Real-World Use:\n\n\nUsed in production environments like AWS, Azure, or corporate data centers\n\n\nHigh performance and stability\n\n\n🔹 Examples of Type 1 Hypervisors:\n\n\nVMware ESXi\n\n\nMicrosoft Hyper-V (bare metal version)\n\n\nXen\n\n\nKVM (in many cases, acts like Type 1)\n\n\n\n✅ Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted)\n🔹 What it is:\nA Type 2 hypervisor runs on top of an existing operating system like any other application.\n🔹 Example:\nYou have a Windows 10 laptop. You install Oracle VirtualBox (a hypervisor software). Now you can create VMs inside VirtualBox, like running Ubuntu or Kali Linux inside a window on your Windows laptop.\n🔹 Real-World Use:\n\n\nUsed by developers, testers, or students for learning, coding, and testing\n\n\nNot ideal for large-scale production due to performance limitations\n\n\n🔹 Examples of Type 2 Hypervisors:\n\n\nOracle VirtualBox\n\n\nVMware Workstation\n\n\nParallels (on macOS)\n\n\nVMware Server\n\n\n\n🧠 Quick Analogy:\n\n\nType 1: Like a hotel built directly on land – strong, efficient, built for serious use.\n\n\nType 2: Like a tent inside your house – useful for quick setup, but depends on the house.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you want a diagram or interview-style Q&amp;A version!\n✅ Which Hypervisors Does AWS Use?\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) primarily uses Type 1 (Bare Metal) Hypervisors in its infrastructure for running virtual machines (EC2 instances).\n\n🔹 Hypervisors Used by AWS:\n\n\nXen Hypervisor\n\n\nEarlier, AWS mainly used Xen, a Type 1 hypervisor.\n\n\nIt provided strong isolation between instances and was widely used for many years.\n\n\n\n\nAWS Nitro Hypervisor (Modern and current)\n\n\nAWS is now shifting to its own custom lightweight hypervisor called Nitro.\n\n\nNitro is based on KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) but optimized by AWS.\n\n\nIt offers better performance, security, and low overhead compared to traditional hypervisors.\n\n\n\n\n\n🔍 What’s Nitro?\n\n\nNitro System is a combination of:\n\n\nHardware + Software + Hypervisor\n\n\nProvides near bare-metal performance\n\n\nUsed for most modern EC2 instance types\n\n\n\n\n\n✅ In summary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS HypervisorTypeUsageXenType 1Older EC2 instance typesNitro (based on KVM)Type 1Most modern EC2 instances\nLet me know if you want a list of EC2 instance types that use Nitro!\nVIRTUAL MACHINE SETUP(VM SETUP)\nMANUAL SETUP\n1.ORCAL VM VIRTUAL BOX — Hypervisor\nISO FILE  — CentOS &amp; Ubuntu\nLOGIN TOOLS — Git Bash &amp; Putty\nAUTOMATED SETUP\n\nVirtualbox -Hypervisor\nVagrant  — Creates vms with Vagrantfile\ncommands  —vagrant up\n\nMANUAL PROCESS\n1.Open Virtualbox and follow wizard to Setup VM\n2.Install OS from ISO\nAttach ISO file to the vm and power on to open installnation wizard\nAutomate process\n1.Create vagrantfile (vagrant init boxname)\n2.

Scalability\n\n\nIf many users visit:\n\n\nS3 + CDN handles static files easily (scalable by default)\n\n\nEC2 may be behind an Auto Scaling Group + Load Balancer\n\n\nMongoDB Atlas auto-scales based on your plan\n\n\n\n\n\n🔁 WHO TALKS TO WHOM?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFromToPurposeBrowserS3/CDNDownload frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)BrowserEC2 (via DNS)API RequestsEC2MongoDB AtlasQuery &amp; store app dataEC2S3 (optional)Upload/download media/filesFrontend (JS)api.domain.comAJAX requests to backend\n\n🧪 Example Flow: User Loads Product List\n\n\nUser visits yourdomain.com\n\n\nBrowser downloads frontend from S3\n\n\nFrontend JavaScript makes:\njs\nCopyEdit\nfetch(&quot;api.yourdomain.com/products&quot;)\n\n\nDNS resolves api.yourdomain.com → EC2 IP\n\n\nEC2 receives request (via Nginx) and hits your backend code\n\n\nBackend queries MongoDB Atlas\n\n\nResponse (JSON) sent back to browser\n\n\n\n🌐 Bonus: Hosting Without AWS or Azure\nIf you’re hosting locally:\n\n\nYou can run your backend on your computer (localhost:3000)\n\n\nExpose it to public with tools like:\n\n\nNgrok (for testing)\n\n\nPort forwarding via your WiFi router (not secure)\n\n\nPublic IP + Domain + Router NAT + SSL setup (advanced)\n\n\n\n\nBut for production, use cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean.\n\n✅ Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponentHosted OnPurposeFrontendS3 + CloudFrontServe static websiteBackendEC2 (Ubuntu/Red Hat)Handle APIs, business logicDBMongoDB AtlasData storageDNSRoute 53 / GoDaddyDomain name mappingCDN (optional)CloudFrontSpeed &amp; cache static contentWeb ServerNginx/ApacheRoute traffic to app on EC2\nLINUX COMMANDS\n1.ls — show file in that folder\n2. cd foldername — go that folder\n3. cat foler — open that folder\n4. mkdir foldername — create folder\n5. mkdir folder1 foldername 2 —create multiple folder\n6. touch filetext1.text —create empty\n7. touch devopsfile{1..10}.text — create 10 file with 1 to 10 with prefix of devops\n8. cp — it used to copy from source and paste in destination(example useage: cp devopsfile.ext dev/)\n9. cd ~ —go to homedirectory\n10. cp -r dev backupdir/  — copy director and paste directory\n11. mv  source and destination — it used move file from source to destination\n12. mv devops1.text devops22.text — it rename as well\n13. mv  ‘*.text textdir’ — it mean it move all text to text dir\n14. rm filename ---remove filename and can remove director but use  -r\n15. rm -rf — forecefull delte\nVIM EDITOR\n1.command mode\n2.insert mode\n3.extend command mode\n1.Need to install vim editor\nsudo yum install vim -y\nvim file1.text — create file with editor mode\nclick i — it used for edit file\nonce edited click on escape for back to command\n:w for save the file\nescape\n:q — go back to termianl\n:wq save and quit\n:q!

It allows a single physical machine to run multiple operating systems simultaneously by creating isolated environments (VMs) on one host system.\n\n\nOne computer can handle multiple jobs by running multiple operating systems.\n\n\nFor example, using virtualization tools, we can run Windows, Linux, and macOS VMs on a single machine.\n\n\nThis enables developers or testers to run various environments in parallel.\n\n\n\nLife Before Virtualization\n\n\nApplications (e.g., Tomcat, Apache, MySQL) required dedicated physical servers.\n\n\nManaging physical servers was expensive, required space, cooling, and high maintenance.\n\n\nIt was inefficient, especially when servers were underutilized.\n\n\n\nBenefits / Advantages of Virtual Machines\n\n\nAllows one computer to run multiple operating systems.\n\n\nConverts physical resources (CPU, RAM, storage) into virtual resources.\n\n\nEach virtual machine runs in a completely isolated environment.\n\n\nEach VM requires its own operating system, offering flexibility.\n\n\nServer virtualization is the most common form, widely used in cloud and enterprise environments.\n\n\n\nKey Terminologies\n\n\nHost OS: The actual physical computer and its operating system (e.g., your laptop running Windows 10).\n\n\nGuest OS: The operating system installed inside a virtual machine (e.g., Ubuntu running in VirtualBox).\n\n\nVM (Virtual Machine): The software-based computer running under virtualization.\n\n\nSnapshot: A backup of a VM’s current state; useful for rollback or recovery.\n\n\nHypervisor: The software or firmware that enables virtualization by creating and managing VMs.\n\n\n\nTypes of Hypervisors\n1. Type 1 – Bare Metal Hypervisors\n\n\nRun directly on physical hardware without a host OS.\n\n\nUsed in production environments (high performance, better resource management).\n\n\nExamples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen\n\n\n2. Type 2 – Hosted Hypervisors\n\n\nRun on top of an existing operating system (like any other application).\n\n\nUsed for learning, testing, or development environments.\n\n\nExamples: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, VMware Server\n\n\n\n✅ What is a Cluster?\nA cluster is a group of connected computers (or servers) that work together as a single system to improve performance, availability, and scalability.\nInstead of one powerful machine doing all the work, a cluster spreads the workload across multiple machines (called nodes).\n\n💡 Simple Example:\nThink of a cluster like a team — if one member (node) is unavailable or busy, others can take over. Together, they work faster and more reliably than a single person.\n\n🔑 Key Features of a Cluster:\n\n\nHigh Availability: If one node fails, others keep the system running.\n\n\nLoad Balancing: Work is distributed evenly across all nodes.\n\n\nScalability: You can add more nodes to handle more traffic or jobs.\n\n\nRedundancy: Data or services are often duplicated to prevent failure.\n\n\n\n🖥️ Types of Clusters:\n\n\nLoad Balancing Cluster – Distributes incoming traffic across nodes\n\n\nHigh Availability (HA) Cluster – Ensures services stay up even if one node fails\n\n\nCompute Cluster – Used for high-performance computing (e.g., simulations, data processing)\n\n\nStorage Cluster – Combines storage from multiple nodes (e.g., Hadoop HDFS, Ceph)\n\n\n\n🚀 Real-World Examples:\n\n\nKubernetes cluster (for container orchestration)\n\n\nHadoop cluster (for big data processing)\n\n\nAWS EC2 Auto Scaling Group (works like a cluster)\n\n\nLet me know if you’d like a diagram or a short interview-friendly definition too.\nSure! Here’s a simple explanation with real-world examples to help you clearly understand the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 Hypervisors:\n\n✅ Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal)\n🔹 What it is:\nA Type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the physical hardware. There is no operating system between the hypervisor and the hardware.\n🔹 Example:\nImagine you have a server machine in a data center. Instead of installing Windows or Linux first, you install VMware ESXi directly onto the server. Then you create virtual machines (VMs) inside ESXi. Each VM can run its own OS, like Ubuntu, CentOS, or Windows Server.\n🔹 Real-World Use:\n\n\nUsed in production environments like AWS, Azure, or corporate data centers\n\n\nHigh performance and stability\n\n\n🔹 Examples of Type 1 Hypervisors:\n\n\nVMware ESXi\n\n\nMicrosoft Hyper-V (bare metal version)\n\n\nXen\n\n\nKVM (in many cases, acts like Type 1)\n\n\n\n✅ Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted)\n🔹 What it is:\nA Type 2 hypervisor runs on top of an existing operating system like any other application.\n🔹 Example:\nYou have a Windows 10 laptop. You install Oracle VirtualBox (a hypervisor software). Now you can create VMs inside VirtualBox, like running Ubuntu or Kali Linux inside a window on your Windows laptop.\n🔹 Real-World Use:\n\n\nUsed by developers, testers, or students for learning, coding, and testing\n\n\nNot ideal for large-scale production due to performance limitations\n\n\n🔹 Examples of Type 2 Hypervisors:\n\n\nOracle VirtualBox\n\n\nVMware Workstation\n\n\nParallels (on macOS)\n\n\nVMware Server\n\n\n\n🧠 Quick Analogy:\n\n\nType 1: Like a hotel built directly on land – strong, efficient, built for serious use.\n\n\nType 2: Like a tent inside your house – useful for quick setup, but depends on the house.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you want a diagram or interview-style Q&amp;A version!\n✅ Which Hypervisors Does AWS Use?\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) primarily uses Type 1 (Bare Metal) Hypervisors in its infrastructure for running virtual machines (EC2 instances).\n\n🔹 Hypervisors Used by AWS:\n\n\nXen Hypervisor\n\n\nEarlier, AWS mainly used Xen, a Type 1 hypervisor.\n\n\nIt provided strong isolation between instances and was widely used for many years.\n\n\n\n\nAWS Nitro Hypervisor (Modern and current)\n\n\nAWS is now shifting to its own custom lightweight hypervisor called Nitro.\n\n\nNitro is based on KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) but optimized by AWS.\n\n\nIt offers better performance, security, and low overhead compared to traditional hypervisors.\n\n\n\n\n\n🔍 What’s Nitro?\n\n\nNitro System is a combination of:\n\n\nHardware + Software + Hypervisor\n\n\nProvides near bare-metal performance\n\n\nUsed for most modern EC2 instance types\n\n\n\n\n\n✅ In summary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS HypervisorTypeUsageXenType 1Older EC2 instance typesNitro (based on KVM)Type 1Most modern EC2 instances\nLet me know if you want a list of EC2 instance types that use Nitro!\nVIRTUAL MACHINE SETUP(VM SETUP)\nMANUAL SETUP\n1.ORCAL VM VIRTUAL BOX — Hypervisor\nISO FILE  — CentOS &amp; Ubuntu\nLOGIN TOOLS — Git Bash &amp; Putty\nAUTOMATED SETUP\n\nVirtualbox -Hypervisor\nVagrant  — Creates vms with Vagrantfile\ncommands  —vagrant up\n\nMANUAL PROCESS\n1.Open Virtualbox and follow wizard to Setup VM\n2.Install OS from ISO\nAttach ISO file to the vm and power on to open installnation wizard\nAutomate process\n1.Create vagrantfile (vagrant init boxname)\n2.

Here’s a clearer explanation of your point, rewritten for accuracy and clarity:\n\n✅ Scenario Explanation:\nLet’s say:\n\n\nA user connects their laptop to a Wi-Fi router.\n\n\nThe laptop gets an IP address from the router (e.g., 192.168.1.5).\n\n\nNow, when you create a Virtual Machine (e.g., using VMware, VirtualBox, etc.), that VM can also get access to the same Wi-Fi network by using the host laptop’s Wi-Fi adapter.\n\n\n\n🛠️ How this Works (Bridge Networking):\nWhen you set the VM’s network adapter to “Bridged” mode, it shares the host’s physical adapter (in this case, the Wi-Fi adapter). As a result:\n\n\nThe VM appears as a separate device on the same Wi-Fi network.\n\n\nIt will get its own IP address from the router (e.g., 192.168.1.6).\n\n\nThe router sees both the host and the VM as separate devices.\n\n\n\n🧠 Key Concept:\n\nBridge mode connects the VM’s virtual NIC (Network Interface Card) directly to the host’s physical NIC (Wi-Fi or Ethernet), making the VM act like a physical machine on the network.\n\n\n🔁 Comparison with NAT Mode:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeVM Gets Own IP?Access to Local Network?Internet Access?NAT❌ (Shares host’s IP)Limited (no incoming connections)✅Bridged✅ (Own IP from router)✅ Full access✅\n\n🧪 Example:\n\n\nHost (Laptop) Wi-Fi IP: 192.168.0.100\n\n\nVM (Bridged): Gets IP like 192.168.0.101\n\n\nBoth can ping each other and access internet/router resources.44\n\n\nVAGRANT TOOLS\nIts a tool for writing automation script for create vm\nManual VM mangement problem\n1.OS installnation\n2.Time consuming\n3.Manul⇒ humar error\n4.Tough to replicate mutiple vms\n5.Need to document entire setup\nVagrant for VMS\n1.NO OS installnation\nVM images/box\nFree box availble for vagrant cloud\n2.vagrantfile\nManage vm settings in a file\nVM changes in a vagrant file\nProvisioning\nSimple commands\nVagrant init boxname\nVagrant up —ON VM,\nVagrant SSH  -login vm\nvagrant halt — off vm\nvagrant destroy — delete vm\nFOR UBUNTU JAMMY\nVagrant.configure(“2”) do |config| config.vm.box = “ubuntu/jammy64” config.vm.box_version = “20241002.0.0” end"},"notes/Devops/Vagrant-Setup":{"title":"Vagrant Setup","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"sdvVAGRANT TOOLS\nIts a tool for writing automation script for create vm\nManual VM mangement problem\n1.OS installnation\n2.Time consuming\n3.Manul⇒ humar error\n4.Tough to replicate mutiple vms\n5.Need to document entire setup\nVagrant for VMS\n1.NO OS installnation\nVM images/box\nFree box availble for vagrant cloud\n2.vagrantfile\nManage vm settings in a file\nVM changes in a vagrant file\nProvisioning\nSimple commands\nVagrant init boxname\nVagrant up —ON VM,\nVagrant SSH  -login vm\nvagrant halt — off vm\nvagrant destroy — delete vm\nVAGRANT ARCHITECTURE\n\n\nWANT TO KNOW PRESENT WORKING DIRECTORY\nPWD —COMMANDS\nmkdir /d/vagrant-vms  (create folder in d directort as vagrant-vms)\ncreate two folder in vagrant-vms\n1.Dowload centos image from vagrant cloud\nportal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover/eurolinux-vagrant/centos-stream-9\n2.search centos 9 and go to # eurolinux-vagrant/centos-stream-9\n3. using gitbash on the directory\n4.Vagrant.configure(“2”) do |config| config.vm.box = “eurolinux-vagrant/centos-stream-9” config.vm.box_version = “9.0.48” end\nusing termianl create vagrant file using init commad\nvagrant init eurolinux-vagrant/centos-stream-9\nvagrant up — for up vm\nif any issue occured realted to error:channel:Next initialize security context\nvbox hardening it was antivirus you need to disable that same as if your’re using corporate same issue will appear\nvagrant box list — for show download images\nvagrant status — for show vm staus\nvagrant ssh — it used for login into vm\nwhoami —it used to get username\nsudo -i —it is used to switch into root user\nexit —it used to logout from vm(should not able to shutdown if you are in vm in termianl)\nvagrant halt —power off vm(shutdonw)\nvagrant reload —rebot the vm ( if any change applied in settings this commad need to use)\nif you change box name then delete vm and create vm using that box name\nvagrant destroy — to delete vm\nvagrant box list — can see donwloaded box\nvagrant global-status —to see all vm status\nvagrant global-status —prune      —only show which is create via vagrant not directly from virtualbox\nhistory — get all commands we entered in termial\nvagrant global-status using this command you can get id of created vm and you can delete vagrant destort _id this used to delete that vm using id\nimportant: should poweroff vm before power of computer\n\n/etc/os-release = have cofiguration os in vm\nsudo -i == it is used to switch root home director  — root home directory\nonce swiched cd/ it used to root directory that contains all files of system  —root directory\n/bin or anything it means it was absolute path\n/root/proc  — uptime\nfree -m — it show ram remaining\nif you want to switch to home directory then give exit commad from root directory"},"projects/index":{"title":"Projects","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Over the years, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects — from weekend experiments to solutions for real-world problems.
