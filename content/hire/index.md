## 👋 Hey there!

 I’m **K. Boopathi**, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a love for tackling complex problems and staying ahead of the curve in the world of **Web Development**, **DevOps**, **Generative AI**, and beyond

By day, I explore the guts of infrastructure, and by night (and weekends), I build quirky, powerful AI side projects that solve real problems.

Whether it’s optimizing backend systems or designing tools that turn interviews into insightful conversations, I bring the same energy: **curiosity, creativity, and clean code.**

##  What Sets Me Apart

#### Full-Stack Thinking  From Infra to AI
I don't just build features I think end-to-end. Whether it's spinning up scalable infra or optimizing AI latency, I care about the whole system, not just the code.
#### Detective Mindset for Debugging
Inspired by Sherlock Holmes (yes, I write about it too), I treat every bug as a case to crack. I love diving deep, asking the right questions, and solving the mystery others gave up on.

#### Bias for Action
I prototype fast, learn faster, and ship things that work. Most of my projects were built over a weekend then improved through real-world usage.

#### Clear Communication
From writing dev-friendly blogs to building polished internal tools, I focus on making complex things simple  for teammates, users, and future me.

#### Passion + Precision
I chase hard problems because they teach me more. Whether it's designing a robust AI pipeline or building a zero-downtime deployment system  I aim for clean, scalable solutions.

## My Ideal Workplace

I’m seeking a tech environment that:

- Offers competitive compensation and benefits
- Values creativity and innovation in technology
- Prioritizes a positive work environment and employee satisfaction
- Makes a meaningful impact through technology
- Supports flexible work arrangements  I’m also open to discussing part-time positions
- Respects work-life balance
- Encourages and supports professional growth

## A bit more about me

- 🧩 I like breaking things just to fix them better.
- 🧘 I enjoy debugging servers almost as much as solving puzzles.
- 📚 You’ll find me reading detective novels, bingeing AI research papers, or automating things no one asked me to.
- 🧠 I write blog series like *“A Sherlock Holmes Debugging Tale”* and *“Code Against the Clock.”*

> *"I'm an introvert until the code breaks  then I’m loud and all in."*
